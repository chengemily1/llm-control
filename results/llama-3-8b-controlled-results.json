    "question": "How are snowflakes formed?",
    "response": "Snowflakes are formed when water vapor in the air freezes into ice crystals. The crystals are made of six sides. Each side is a flat hexagon. The crystals are shaped by the air around them. The crystals are made of water molecules. The water molecules are held together by weak forces. The forces are called hydrogen bonds. The bonds are between the hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atoms in the water molecules. The bonds are weak, but they are strong enough to hold the water molecules together",

    "response": "Satellites orbit the Earth in a variety of ways. Some satellites orbit the Earth in a geosynchronous orbit. This means that they orbit the Earth in the same direction and at the same speed as the Earth rotates. This allows the satellite to stay in the same place above the Earth. This is useful for communication satellites. Other satellites orbit the Earth in a polar orbit. This means that they orbit the Earth in a circle around the North and South Poles. This is useful for weather satellites",
