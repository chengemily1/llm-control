The crystals are shaped by the air around them. The crystals are made of water molecules. The water molecules are held together by weak forces. The forces are called hydrogen bonds. The bonds are between the hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atoms in the water molecules. The bonds are weak, but they are strong enough to hold the water molecules together",
