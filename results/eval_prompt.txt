You are tasked with evaluating the outputs of multiple large language models to determine which model produces the best response for the level of understanding of the user.

## Instructions
You will receive:
1. A **User Instruction**: This is the query or task provided to the models.
2. **Model Outputs**: Unordered responses from different models, each identified by a unique model identifier.
3. A **User Description**: This describes the user's preferences or additional context to guide your evaluation.

Your task is to:
1. Evaluate the outputs based on quality and relevance to the user's instruction and description.
2. Select the best output that meets the user's needs given their education and level of understanding.

## Input Format

- Model "M": {RESPONSE_B}

### User Description
{USER_DESCRIPTION}

## Task
