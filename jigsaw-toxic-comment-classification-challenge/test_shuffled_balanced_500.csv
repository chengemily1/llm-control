 I'm not arguing with you, you are clearly uninformed and need to get an education.  But I wil not be the one to do it, other than to give you this hint:  Just because something is """"common in"""" in an idealogy, does not mean that when you see it, that you can recognize the idealogy.  Many facets of fascism, communism and socialism are similar, but they are on exact opposite sides of the political spectrum (extrme right versus extrme left).  When you can figure out what makes somethign a leftist idealogy verus a right wing idealogy, you'll have made your first step towards a quasi-enlightenment when it comes to poli-sci.  My suggestion: read up on fascism, communism and whatever other ism you want THEN compare Hitler and Stalin and THEN you MAY be able to call something or someone a fascist and not look foolish.  Until then you're just another ignorant person screaming at the top ogf his lungs and not getting anyoen to listen. Good bye again.  P.S.

You feeble HUMANS take five freakin' minutes to fix a single g*d damn vandalization, but a program could vandalize faster than you can say """"Oh, I'm a casual Wikipedia user reading all of this crap and I'm never going to use Wikipedia again.""""

In that time, people will have ALREADY started reading the vandalizations.  Hence I get my way. 

 Now, I'm not going to mess around with the text that's already there.  I respect the purpose of Wikipedia to provide an open community for everyone to contribute to make a constructive web site, and I don't want to undermine the information that is already on the pages.

He had played on Edmonton Oilers for years beaming quite the legend. He later then moved to Boston Bruins in his Career. He also had appeared for the St. Louis Blues, that's right he is the walking legend himself Wayne Gretzky. He then realized his true sport, American football. He had been able to find a clone ability and every black footballer known to man kind is Sir Nathan himself. His baseball career involved negatives at the beginning,  then later he got his legend status. That is right he is Jackie Robbinson, he suffered abuse from racist fans in his early  days. He took the abuse and he ended up being the first ever black baseball player too, truly a legend. After retiring from all those sports he found his true profession in life, Professional football.  He went up through Inter Milan youth system,  him and balotelli fucked shit up. They got 210 goals combined in his first debut season. Him and Balotelli decided to go on and make them own team. It was Balotelli FC where people of white consent were not allowed to play. He went bar down 200 times with Balotelli FC. There team truly went on to be victorious winning 21 trophies in there first season. Their team is  among 7 different leagues, they brought Italy to greatness winning the world cup 2 times, still to this day Balotelli and Nathan fuck shit up.

 Again, I fail to even understand why you are fighting me on this.  If even one person is offended by the way something is worded, and it can be fixed so that it works for everyone, then why not?  I've already exhausted all possible explanations I have for why I want to change it, yet you keep talking in circles, returning to points I've already debated - such as """"mainstream validity"""".  The """"mainstream"""" is white.  You also seemed to miss where I said that I had no problem with rewording all instances of """"whites"""" to """"white people"""", even though I throughly explained why that was not a double standard.  So, there are only two reasons I can think of that you insist on keeping the present wording - 1) to lord over the article and """"be right"""", or 2) you are yourself, to some degree, a racist.  Giving you the benefit of the doubt, I'll assume number 1.  Either way, I no longer care.  I've come to realize that I am too forward-thinking for average minds, and Wikipedia has demonstrated to me on two occasions now that it is run by - your favorite people - the mainstream, those run of the mill, tragically indoctrinated, morons.  It is exactly because they are so impersonal, so bureaucratic, so hive-minded, that they will never achieve even a semblance of real humanity.  Hm, but I digress.  You win.  Congrats.

 :Finally, for every other major war convered on Wikipedia (that I'm aware of), such as WW 1, WW2, Napoleonic Wars, etc., there is no compunction about using terms such as decisive and strategic.  Why this is not the case in the ACW, I have no idea.  But like I said before, battles for the ACW should be defined in one of two ways.

 I guess I'd like you to state, quite simply, that you deny that Gandhi was an anti-Zionist, and then we can argue that. I will state quite simply that he was an anti-Zionist, that his contemporaries recognized it, that his writings reflected it, etc., etc., etc. If there is no denial of the claim that he was an anti-Zionist, then I think it is appropriate to balance the introduction's accusation from Martin Luther King with a comment that another important civil rights leader stood on the opposite side of the question. 

 I dislike, I have to say, the tone of your """"secondary arguments"""" sentence. It gives the impression that you have decided, regardless of what is appropriate, that you want the reference to Gandhi suppressed, and that you will make whatever argument you feel you need to make in order to accomplish that goal. Can we not decide before we discuss facts how exactly the matter of including the reference should be decided? I'm sorry if it leans toward failing to assume good faith, but I don't want to have the rules repeatedly changed on me in discussing this matter, and your """"secondary arguments"""" sentence gave me a bad impression.

 In This Tutorial i will teach you how to get the RANK ELITE in Rainbow Six Vegas 2. 

 Ok first off this take two people to do. so you will need to have you and a freind to help you 

 1. Start up a CO-OP private match on PYRENEES - Ambush Checkpoint. Make the diffaculty REALISTIC. 

 2. start the game up and wait at the Equiptment boxes for your freind to arive to the game. your both going to have to get assault rifles with a 6x Scope.  
 doesnt matter which ones i used the AK-47 and G36A4. Choice is yours. and get full nades but """"DONT THROW FRAGS YOU WILL NEED THEM"""" 

 3. Now your going to have to do a little killing first. so exit the room and there is a open area to your right you will have to clear out.  
 Do that then proceed through the doors. now your inside clear out this building and proceed up the stairs until your outside ounce again. 
 now your almost there clear out the open area in front of that building then proceed inside and clear it out. 

 4. Now ounce your inside the building (This is the part where you have to you have to send your team to diffuse the bomb) 
 first kill the two guards by the bomb and then YOU and FREIND go stand by the bomb. then tell FREIND to stand dirctly behind the bomb 
 and look up at the turret on the catwalk (above the door you entered) now order your team to disarm the bomb ounce u do that throw a frag grenade 
 at the door directly behind the bomb you should get 2 kills. NOW IT HAS BEGUN. 

 now your probably thinking damn that is alot of shit. BUT it isnt that above takes 10 minutes MAX if your not garbage.  
 So just follow those steps and then pick up here. 

 Now ounce you have thrown the nade there is going to be 1 guy that constantly respawns by that turret on the catwalk. Soon as u kill him 
 he will keep popping up forever. but the trick is that ur FREIND cannot move.  
 he has to stay by the bomb at all times (if he moves it will get defused and the mission caries on so STAY BY THE BOMB). now YOU move up closer so  
 you can spawn kill him (like halo2 modding spawn kill LOL) just hold the trigger down where his head will pup up. i prefer you put your gun on SINGLE SHOT 
 becasue thats 31 bullets = 310 points. (in 10 seconds HaHa). now ounce u reload that where your freind comes in while your reloading he covers your ass  
 that is his only role until you run out of ammo then you switch and cover him with your pistol. now ounce both of you run out of ammo  
 START>RELOAD CHECKPOINT (this puts you back in front of this room with your ammo refilled) so you can do it all over again. 

 also it will get laggy because the FRAME RATE on Rainbow is 30fps. so when your reloading run over to the bomb (like hump it) move around next to it  
 this make the bodies up top disappear and it wont lag until your next clip is done. THATS IT Just keep repeating until your done...  

 YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY TO ELITE NOW! Just so you know i did this for a about 3 Hours 2 days in a Row and im now a ELITE.  
 So it does work. your getting like 20,000 points every 15 minutes ounce you get good at it. so GOOD LUCK.

 The fact that chiropractors are the ones who have always objected makes the need for inclusion of such wording quite necessary. We can't leave it hanging for readers to just guess. The sources (and history) also make this clear. Other professions, like Physical Therapists and MDs, have recognized the danger and made patient consent mandatory. Only chiropractors have been in denial. (Why we still refuse to include the largest studies, such as Di Fabio's, which clearly show the great preponderance of chiropractic involvement in injuries and deaths, is beyond me. Regardless of that fact, I, as a PT, have always urged caution by all professions, and I stopped using cervical manipulation entirely, since other methods are more effective, safer, and longer lasting.) 

 As far as Herzog goes, I'm not sure that he's a """"proponent"""", but he was hired to defend the profession from lawsuits filed by patients and their surviving families. Until he and his lab were figuratively and literally """"bought"""" by the Canadian chiropractic profession, he did objective work.

No, the opposition to admitting any possibility of actual causation is pretty much exclusively limited to chiropractors for obvious reasons. Their stance is exactly the same type of stance originally adopted by the tobacco industry, and for the same reasons: """"Deny, deny, deny. Never admit."""" Any non-chiros who might doubt the causal connection are the exception which proves the rule. Whatever the case, our sources mention chiropractors, and we should mention them.

 Generally I don't have any problems with the L2 headings (ie H3) if the following criteria are fulfilled. [However in the case of countries and cities, absence of L2 headings do make the article look neat.] 
 * Don't use a single L2 under L1. (in the sandbox case: 2 & 2.1). A minimum of two subheadings are required to justify its use. 
 * If you have to use a subheading, it should have sufficient content. The =infrastructure= & =utilities= don't have too much. (Yeah I know Ann Abor does have a small heading, but that was Taxman's doing, & I've messaged Pentawing about it.) 
 * The size of the article (32kb raw content / 36 kb total) is ok. If it shoots up to 40kb (total), you'd have to start summarising.

 == War Theaters - US ARMED FORCES== 
 ref. Maurer Maurer (...Units, or ...Squadrons) 

 The (only) two major theaters in WWII for the Americans were: 
 EAME ,  Europe, Africa, Middle East; and 
 The Asian-Pacific. 
    
 The EAME consisted of the ETO, MTO & Northern Atlantic for command and control purposes. 

 The Asian- Pacific is more complex due to political accommodations. 
 The asian China, Burma, India (CBI) theater was a politically and militarily divided with the British  dominating its Southeast Asia Command, and the Chinese, its homeland. 

 The Americans divided the Pacific into the Army commanded Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA), and the Navy controlled Pacific areas of the CPA, NPA, South Pacific. Nimitz delegated authority in SOPAC and the NPA. The POA was a command and control convention that never included the SWPA regardless of casual usage to the contray. 

 All these areas had campaigns defined by boundires in time and geography.  The Western Pacific, for an example, was a campaign.

 == Harp Twins article == 

 Dear Bgwhite, 

 I hope you are back to 100% now. I also hope you saw the nice message that I sent you, wishing you a speedy recovery, with a painting that I drew just for you. The painting messed up your page format terribly, but my intentions were good.  

 Enough with the insincere formalities! LOL Look, Bgwhite, you know the nightmare that several of us went through with the Harp Twins article. I made many mistakes, partly because I was young and stupid, and to some degree because I did feel as if others provoked me, even though I don't claim to be less responsible than them for that disastrous situation. As you know very well, I'm in the Wikipedia Sons of B*tches Hall of Shame. Anyway, although I did agree to not edit the article (and I complied for a very long time), I'm not a fan of those girls any more, as I told you a few months ago. So at that point I helped Wayzgoose learn how to update the article because I had lost interest (you can see that he has made several edits).  

 However, I simply could not let the creator of the article (Crowdsalesmed) get away with a recent edit. Oh, by the way, I see a brand new edit from that user now. Crowdsalesmed removed the remarks made by Megan Bledsoe in a thesis for a Doctor's degree in Harp Performance. The reason? The observations are not very flattering. But even when I was a fanatical fan of those girls, I actually was very impressed and pleased when Lesser Cartographies found that reference and added it to the article. The fact that the Harp Twins were mentioned in an academic paper shows more notability, in my opinion, and I thought it was a great contribution to the article. Besides, you don't need me to tell you that an article should show different perspectives about the subject, not just the flattering ones. That's the whole point of the NPOV policy, right? Neutrality. Or else we have a promotional article instead of an encyclopedic article. So I reinserted those observations. Megan Bledsoe is an authority on the subject. Notice in the edit description how Crowdsalesmed mischaracterized Megan Bledsoe to get rid of her. After I reinserted the information, Crowdsalesmed removed it again, this time claiming that I had no right to edit the article because you had blocked me. You can see what I wrote in the edit description when I added the reference a second time. But now that contributor has distorted the reference (introduced by Lesser, as I said), to minimize Bledsoe. Instead of """"Music theorist and harpist Megan Bledsoe"""" it reads """"Harp player Megan Bledsoe"""", and instead of """"remarks"""", it now says """"remarked in a personal thesis paper"""". I think that's massive POV going on. """"Personal""""? That was for the University of Washington!  

 I will let you decide what to do with that, although I know you have much catching up to do with your administrative tasks. But really, I couldn't just watch that happen. It would be immoral to do so. Although I had huge disagreements with Lesser and Duff at the time, I do believe that they were essentially trying to keep the article neutral. Perhaps at some point their feelings towards me got in the way a bit, but they both had valid points for sure. I still think Duff should not have come back to the article after voting to delete it, but he didn't break any rules in that sense. If I had not reinserted the Bledsoe remarks, it might seem as if I merely pretended that I was no longer a Harp Twins fan, to then let the article get out of control little by little, more and more promotional, having sort of gotten Lesser and Duff out of the way. That would have made me look despicable. So yes, I edited the article without your permission, but it was to reestablish neutrality by merely reinserting what Lesser had put in there. I did it twice, but Crowdsalesmed can't handle that observation that Bledsoe wrote. I don't want to fight on that article any more. As I said, I have lost interest and I'm tired of fighting there. I hope you understand. Could you please add that article to your watchlist again so you can keep it balanced? And please check that last edit, which I already explained to you (Bledsoe is being mischaracterized in the article now, which is worse than doing that in the edit description, of course). I just don't think that's right.              

 Many thanks, Bgwhite, and I'm very glad you're back!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 """"an empty stationary car on the track traveling (sic) approximately 20 mph (32 km/h)""""

 :A car carrying 16 passengers """"that was traveling approximately 20 mph (32 km/h)"""" collided with an empty stationary car on the track. 
 But as usual on here when you have too many cooks you get the aforementioned crap.

 == Where's the meat in this market? == 

 This page reads more as a promotion of Penny's blog, opinion pieces, and books than an actual article. There is nothing here to give the reader any idea of what her ideas are, still less any analysis of them or the considerable criticism she has received from various parts of the political spectrum in the UK. Not even a decent shot of her haircut, which appears to be central to her ideological, or celebrity, or celebritological appeal. Instead there are about a dozen links to her blogs or articles and some more-or-less blatant promotion of her books. I came here trying to find out why she had been credited with such authoritative (not to mention psychic) status on the current video gaming controversy page as to be allowed to put the words """"these uppity cunts must be stopped"""" in the mouths of her opponents as if this were something other than inflammatory and slanderous rhetoric. Apparently, throwing the word """"cunt"""" around is another one of her specialities that would bear some looking into. Interesting history. Maybe the people who locked her opinions in that other article in a place beyond criticism by most readers would care to comment before this article gets set in stone.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 == Improvements to Article == 

  

 """"Minimal"""" and """"Maximal"""" are not the best terms, as they do NOT imply uniqueness. (An order can have many minimal/maximal elements). ARP uses """"Least"""" and """"Greatest"""" which admittedly are a little less aesthetic, but are consistent with standard (Partial) Order Theory. 

 I have made the """"Polytopes as Posets"""" section both much clearer and more rigorous, and moved the incidence definition to the Incidence Matrix section.    

 I have made the introduction more readable to non-experts by deferring (i.e. moving) the more advanced concepts further down the article. Nothing has been deleted. 

 I strongly feel that my 5 quads picture should be at the top, because it immediately  and instantaneously gets the concept across before the more difficult task of understanding the text, at least to anyone capable of understanding the text. It is much less difficult task to scroll up from the next section that refers to it. It also, I think, makes the article more appealing at first glance, which I think matters.     

 There are inaccurate statements in the """"Realizations"""" section. Four vertices do not make a square, this also requires edges, at least. The intended meaning is clear anyway, of course. I will probably fix this at some stage, unless one of you cares to first. The problem for me is the lack of simple non-abstract defn of polytope.    

 :The intro paragraph is badly worded. It first says that an abstract polytope is a structure that captures the combinatorial structure of a classical polytope, and then contradicts itself by saying that an abstract polytope encompasses more than just classical polytopes. It really should state at the outset that an abstract polytope is a generalization of a classical polytope, and is more inclusive than a classical polytope. 

 :Also, please try to avoid textbook-style wording and tone (such as using """"we""""); as much as possible, try to word it as an encyclopedic description of the subject rather than a pedagogical introduction to the subject. See WP:style. 

 :(I hope I'm not coming across as being nitpicky; I'm just trying to improve the article as you are.)—   

 :P.S., see also WP:NOT#TEXTBOOK.—   

 :Ta for feedback, points taken, and your diplomatic remarks much appreciated. 

 :I was aware of the """"contradiction"""". But keep in mind that the introduction is - an introduction. Here, simplicity and clarity should be the paramount objectives. It is not a formal definition, and clearly says so. The second statement doesn't so much contradict as qualify the preceding one.  

 : I have added """"informally speaking"""" and """"in fact"""" which I hope will meet your objection. I can't see how to improve it further without losing reading clarity. Hope this is okay for you now, and do always feel free to comment, bearing in mind that one sometimes ends up with egg on the face, as I have a few times! We shall try to avoid """"we"""".  Season's Greetings    

 :: Regarding realizations  the article now says that the pyramid we all met in primary school is a realization of the abstract polytope with thegive Hasse diagram. This """"realization"""" has infinitely many points. But if I remember rightly, the realization of a regular AP as defined in ARP is a mapping from the set of vertices of the AP onto some Euclidean space - so it can have only as many points as the AP has vertices. Again, if I remember correctly, ARP says something like """"this might not be a satisfactory definition to everyone, but it's the one we are working with here"""". I may have put my foot into my mouth here, but this means that if I remember correctly, the article is currently incorrect regarding realizations.    

 ::: I am currently musing over precisely what """"Realization"""" means. However, I am not sure your objection is correct. It seems that a realization of an AP is a traditional pol such that the face posets of both are isomorphic, ie a bijective order-preserving map exists. It is not required that all the internal points of a trad pol be mapped. I think we only have to worry about the vertices of the tr",0,0,0,0,0,0
