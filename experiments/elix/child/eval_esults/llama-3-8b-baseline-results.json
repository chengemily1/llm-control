    "question": "How are snowflakes formed?",
    "response": "Snowflakes are formed when water vapor in the air condenses into ice crystals. The ice crystals are formed around a tiny particle of dust or dirt. The ice crystals grow as they fall through the air. The shape of the snowflake depends on the temperature and humidity of the air. The crystals can grow into many different shapes.",

This means that the satellite orbits the Earth at the same rate that the Earth rotates. This allows the satellite to stay in the same position relative to the Earth. Other satellites orbit the Earth in a geostationary orbit. This means that the satellite orbits the Earth at the same rate that the Earth rotates, but the satellite is also in the same position relative to the Earth.",
